**Session 4 Commentary paper**

Compare the experiences of cultural contact described in *The Dawn of Everything* with [*First Contact*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085544/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_4). With allowances made for different historical circumstances, what similarities do you notice? Is there evidence of an indigenous critique?

**Session 6 Commentary paper**

How does the discussion of “political self-consciousness” in *The Dawn of Everything* apply to the events in [*Joe Leahy’s Neighbours*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460476/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)? What different models of politics and personhood do various parties in the film embrace?

**Session 7 Commentary paper**

**Session 17 Commentary paper**

What kinds of theories of culture can you find on display at the [Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology](https://peabody.harvard.edu/home)? Do you notice any tensions between competing theories?

**Session 19 Commentary paper**

Recall Graeber and Wengrow’s discussion (pp. 116–17) of two aspects of ritual: subverting established order and asserting established order. With reference to one or both of this week’s readings, describe how expressive practices (ritual, art, and performance) can function as a mode of resistance. How is that different from political protest?

**Session 23 Commentary paper**

*The* *Dawn of Everything* ends on a note of optimism about humanity’s prospects for “getting unstuck” from restrictive/repressive social formations. Does [*Nomadland*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9770150/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) reflect that optimism, or does it suggest a bleaker vision?

### Commentaries

Of the 10 prompts for 2-page (double-spaced) reading commentaries, students will select 2 each quarter (4 total). These short papers should address specific passages or sections of the readings (include page numbers for any quotations), and will serve as the basis for discussion throughout the semester. To facilitate discussion this should be submitted by 10 AM on the session date.

See the {{% resource_link "712067eb-91d7-44e9-85ea-7ba2af249fae" "Commentaries" %}} section for more detail.
